                <pre class="paragraph">
                    One of the historical tourist places in India, the Red Fort was constructed
                    over ten years from 1638 to 1648. This fort was constructed when Shah 
                    Jahan shifted the capital from Agra to Delhi and it was then known as 
                    the Qila-e-Mubarak. This octagonal fort is one of the most famous historical
                    places in north India and is also the site where the President gives his 
                    speech on Independence Day. The Red fort is truly remarkable and one of 
                    the best historical places in India.

                    Regarded as the site of the first Muslim kingdom in northern India, the
                    Qutub Minar is definitely one of the most historical sites in India. It
                    is one of the finest examples of Indo-Muslim architecture with its intricate
                    red sandstone storeys. These are dotted with carvings and verses from the
                    Quran and are mostly in Arabic and Nagari. Qutub Minar is one of the famous
                    historical places in India and is said to have got its name from Qutb-ud-din
                    Aibak who was the first Muslim ruler of North India. The first mosque in India
                    Quwwat-ul-Islam Masjid is also located at the foot of the Qutub Minar.

                    Banu Begum commissioned the building of this tomb for her husband in the 15th

                    The royal city of Fatehpur Sikri was once the capital of the Mughal era during 
                    Akbar's reign. This royal city is one of the historical tourist places in India
                    and once had palaces, public buildings, mosques, quarters for the king, the 
                    army as well as the servants. Further, the well planned royal city with carved 
                    columns and decorated pillars was built between 1571-1573 AD and   
                    abandoned due to a shortage of water.

                    The 'Palace of Winds' or Hawa Mahal gets its name due to the fact that it looks
                    like a honeycomb of a beehive with its 953 intricate windows. It is also shaped
                    like a crown as the ruler who built it, Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, was a major
                    devotee of Lord Krishna. One of the popular tourist places in Jaipur, this palace
                    is known as the tallest building in the world that doesn't have any foundation. 
                    The palace is curved but still stands firm due to its pyramidal shape.

                <pre class="paragraph">
                    Khajuraho has always been thought of as the place that exemplifies sensuality
                    and eroticism at its best. However this is a misrepresentation as only about 
                    10 percent of the sculptures are sensual and the rest are common depictions. 
                    Countless sculptures depicting love, eternal grace, beauty, delicacy and the 
                    creative arts can be seen in one of the most historical places in India. A 
                    perfect amalgamation of Hinduism and Jainism, Khajuraho temples
                    have carvings of cult icons, demi gods and Apsaras.
